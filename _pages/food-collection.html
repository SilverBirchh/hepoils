      <p>Food collected from you is taken to an anaerobic digestion Plant.  Gases are extracted and these provide a valuable source of renewable energy in the form of electricity.  The solid remains of the waste are used as a fertilizer to aid in the growth of crops.  You can be assured therefore that almost 100% of the collected food waste is recycled.</p>
